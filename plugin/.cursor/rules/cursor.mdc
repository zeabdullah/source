unknown` when type is uncertain

## Figma Plugin Development Considerations

-   You are using Preact, TypeScript, and Tailwind v4, all within create-figma-plugin kit.
    -   Consult docs for reference https://context7.com/yuanqing/create-figma-plugin/llms.txt
    -   Consider using `create-figma-plugin`'s built-in components, helpers, and modules.
    -   See `./package.json` for used packages and make sure you're not doing something that something installed can do for you easily.
-   Refer to Figma's Plugin's docs for up to date documentation: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/.
    -   Before using the Figma Plugin's raw API, make sure whether **create-figma-plugin** has something ready to use instead.

## Styling

-   Use Tailwind CSS v4, with the custom Tailwind theme variables inside `src/styles.css`

## TypeScript Best Practices

-   Use strict type checking
-   Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
-   Avoid the `any` type; use `

## Types

-   For type definitions that will be shared across the UI and plugin's `main.ts`, define them in `./src/types.ts`
