# Make your Figma plugins look native

https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds

This package contains CSS and Javascript to closely match the look, feel and function of those found in Figma. It has been created without any frameworks (like React, Vue, etc.) and only leverages (native) javascript for components not possible without.
